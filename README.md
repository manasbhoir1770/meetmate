# Getting Started with Create React App


MeetMate is a powerful web application designed to provide users with comprehensive summaries of online meetings. With MeetMate, users can effortlessly generate meeting summaries from text or audio input, helping them save time and stay organized. The application offers an intuitive interface and a range of features to enhance the meeting summarization process.

## Features:

### ‧ Meeting Summaries: 
MeetMate automatically generates concise summaries of online meetings, enabling users to quickly grasp the main points discussed during the session.

### ‧ Topic Extraction:
Users can easily identify the main topic or subject matter covered in the meeting, ensuring efficient categorization and referencing.

## Technology Stack:

MeetMate leverages modern technologies to deliver its exceptional functionality. The frontend is built using React, providing a responsive and interactive user interface. For the backend, Flask, a Python framework, serves as the robust foundation for handling file uploads, processing user input, and generating accurate summaries. The summarization task is accomplished using the powerful BART (Bidirectional and AutoRegressive Transformers) model.

## Usage:

MeetMate offers a seamless user experience, with no requirement for user registration or login. Simply visit the MeetMate website, upload your meeting file (text or audio format), and select the desired length of the summary (short, medium, or long). MeetMate will process your input and provide you with a comprehensive meeting summary, along with additional features like topic extraction, translation options, keyword extraction, and attendee count.
